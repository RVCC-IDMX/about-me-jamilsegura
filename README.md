I have learned a lot in this class. For me, this class introduced me to a whole new language that I am still learning. It has been a fun class and I have enjoyed in learning of what goes on behind the scenes of websites. I hae learned how photos, videos, and everything are sized and given permission to work. I have learned how to change colors and fonts to make things look good.
