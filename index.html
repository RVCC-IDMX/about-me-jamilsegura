    <h2>Exerpt from Dr Jekyll</h2>

    <div>

        <p>Into the details of the infamy at which I thus connived (for even now I can scarce grant that I committed it) I have
            no design of entering; I mean but to point out the warnings and the successive steps with which my chastisement
            approached. I met with one accident which, as it brought on no consequence, I shall no more than mention. An act of
            cruelty to a child aroused against me the anger of a passer-by, whom I recognised the other day in the person of
            your kinsman; the doctor and the childâ€™s family joined him; there were moments when I feared for my life; and at
            last, in order to pacify their too just resentment, Edward Hyde had to bring them to the door, and pay them in a
            cheque drawn in the name of Henry Jekyll. But this danger was easily eliminated from the future, by opening an
            account at another bank in the name of Edward Hyde himself; and when, by sloping my own hand backward, I had
            supplied my double with a signature, I thought I sat beyond the reach of fate.</p>
        <p>The pleasures which I made haste to seek in my disguise were, as I have said, undignified; I would scarce use a
            harder term. But in the hands of Edward Hyde, they soon began to turn toward the monstrous. When I would come back
            from these excursions, I was often plunged into a kind of wonder at my vicarious depravity. This familiar that I
            called out of my own soul, and sent forth alone to do his good pleasure, was a being inherently malign and
            villainous; his every act and thought centered on self; drinking pleasure with bestial avidity from any degree of
            torture to another; relentless like a man of stone. Henry Jekyll stood at times aghast before the acts of Edward
            Hyde; but the situation was apart from ordinary laws, and insidiously relaxed the grasp of conscience. It was Hyde,
            after all, and Hyde alone, that was guilty. Jekyll was no worse; he woke again to his good qualities seemingly
            unimpaired; he would even make haste, where it was possible, to undo the evil done by Hyde. And thus his conscience
            slumbered.</p>
        <p>Some two months before the murder of Sir Danvers, I had been out for one of my adventures, had returned at a late
            hour, and woke the next day in bed with somewhat odd sensations. It was in vain I looked about me; in vain I saw the
            decent furniture and tall proportions of my room in the square; in vain that I recognised the pattern of the bed
            curtains and the design of the mahogany frame; something still kept insisting that I was not where I was, that I had
            not wakened where I seemed to be, but in the little room in Soho where I was accustomed to sleep in the body of
            Edward Hyde. I smiled to myself, and in my psychological way, began lazily to inquire into the elements of this
            illusion, occasionally, even as I did so, dropping back into a comfortable morning doze. I was still so engaged
            when, in one of my more wakeful moments, my eyes fell upon my hand. Now the hand of Henry Jekyll (as you have often
            remarked) was professional in shape and size: it was large, firm, white and comely. But the hand which I now saw,
            clearly enough, in the yellow light of a mid-London morning, lying half shut on the bedclothes, was lean, corder,
            knuckly, of a dusky pallor and thickly shaded with a swart growth of hair. It was the hand of Edward Hyde.</p>
